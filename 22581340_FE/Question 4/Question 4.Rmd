<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.

# Introduction

The aim of this report is to examine the top and bottom three actively managed funds and explore the correlation between their performance and investment flows managed by fund managers.

```{r}
# Flows: Indicates the amount of money that has either entered (positive value) or exited (negative value) each fund on a particular date.
# 
# Interpreting the investment flows:
# 
# Positive values in the "Flows" column indicate inflows, meaning that investors have put money into the fund on that specific date.
# Negative values in the "Flows" column indicate outflows, meaning investors have withdrawn money from the fund on that specific date.
# The magnitude of the flows (whether positive or negative) signifies the size or scale of the investment activities for each fund on a given date


# Load Data

# In periods whre the Flows are at its lowest the top 3 funds E473,N924,R928 have an upward trend in returns while the bottom three funds D394, T410,U411 have a downward trend in returns. In periods where the flows are at its highest, the top 3 funds E473,N924,R928 have both an upward and downward trend in returns while the bottom three funds D394, T410,U411 have an upward trend in returns. Therefore overall, the performance of the Flows is not an indicator of the possible returns of the Fund.

# Results

In periods of lowest flows, the top three funds—E473, N924, R928—show an upward trend in returns, whereas the bottom three funds—D394, T410, U411—indicate a downward trend. Conversely, during periods of highest flows, the top three funds exhibit both upward and downward trends in returns, while the bottom three funds showcase an upward trend. Consequently, it appears that the fund performance does not consistently align with the flow pattern, indicating that flow volume might not serve as a reliable predictor of fund returns.
