  This analysis delves into the volatility of the Rand against select currencies, aiming to compare South Africa's currency performance with that of both developing and developed countries. Additionally, the study investigates instances where the Rand demonstrates advantages, particularly during periods of relative strength in the Dollar.

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Statement 1
The South African rand (ZAR) has over the past few years been one of the most volatile currencies;
```{r}
# Calculating Returns and Cleaning.
# I only want a few currencies to compare SA with (other developing countries and developed countries)
rtn <- cncy %>% group_by(Name) %>% 
    mutate(dlogret = log(Price) - log(lag(Price))) %>% mutate(scaledret = (dlogret - 
    mean(dlogret, na.rm = T))) %>% filter(date > dplyr::first(date)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% filter(Name %in% c("SouthAfrica_Cncy","EU_Cncy_Inv","Mexico_Cncy" , "India_Cncy","UK_Cncy_Inv" ))
# So now we have our return data, rtn, with which we will conduct our MV-Volatility modelling.

# MV Conditional Heteroskedasticity tests
xts_rtn <- rtn %>% tbl_xts(., cols_to_xts = "dlogret", spread_by = "Name")
MarchTest(xts_rtn)

# The MARCH test indicates that all the MV portmanteau tests reject the null of no conditional heteroskedasticity, motivating our use of MVGARCH models.
# Motivation for using Multivariate garch is because of the interdependcies between the exchange rate


# I will be using the DCC Model to fit my data
DCCPre <- dccPre(xts_rtn, include.mean = T, p = 0)

# We now have the estimates of volatility for each series. 
# Follow my lead below in changing the output to a usable Xts series for each column in xts_rtn:
Vol <- DCCPre$marVol
colnames(Vol) <- colnames(xts_rtn)
Vol <- 
  data.frame( cbind( date = index(xts_rtn), Vol)) %>% # Add date column which dropped away...
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%  dplyr::tbl_df() 
Vol <- Vol[,-c(2,3,4)]
# make date column a date column...
TidyVol <- Vol %>% gather(Currency, Sigma, -date)
ggplot(TidyVol) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Sigma, colour = Currency))
```

The MARCH test indicates that all the MV portmanteau tests reject the null of no conditional heteroskedasticity, motivating our use of MVGARCH models.

# Statement 2: 
The ZAR has generally performed well during periods where G10 currency carry trades have been favourable and currency valuations relatively cheap. Globally, it has been one of the currencies that most benefit during periods where the Dollar is comparatively strong, indicating a risk-on sentiment.

```{r}
#need to use cncy_carry and cncy_value and cncyIV
# Note: Implied volatility represents the expected volatility of a stock over the life of the option. As expectations change, option premiums react appropriately. Implied volatility is directly influenced by the supply and demand of the underlying options and by the market's expectation of the share price's direction.

#need to get the "return" of ZAR currency to compare it against the carry trades

ZAR_Rand <- cncy %>% filter(Name %in%   "SouthAfrica_Cncy") 

Value <- bind_rows(ZAR_Rand, cncy_value) 

all_Returns <- Value %>% group_by(Name) %>% 
    mutate(returns_curr=Price/lag(Price)-1) 

# 
# all_Returns %>% 
#    ggplot() + 
# geom_line(aes(date, returns_curr, color = Name), alpha = 0.7, 
#     size = 1) + 
# labs(title = "Illustration of Rolling 3 Year Annualized Returns of top 3 and bottom 4 Indices starting at 2021-05-31", 
#     subtitle = "", x = "", y = "Rolling 3 year Returns (Ann.)", 
#     caption = "Note:\nDistortions are not evident now.") +
# fmx_cols() 




all_Returns %>% filter(date>ymd(19900101)) %>% group_by(Name) %>% 
mutate(RollRets_curr = RcppRoll::roll_prod(1 + returns_curr, 365, fill = NA, 
    align = "right")^(365/1095) - 1) %>% 
group_by(date) %>% filter(any(!is.na(RollRets_curr))) %>% 
ungroup() %>% 
   ggplot() + 
geom_line(aes(date, RollRets_curr , color = Name), alpha = 0.7, 
    size = 1) + 
labs(title = "Rolling 3 Year Annualized Currency Returns of ZAR and Indexed G10 Currency", 
    subtitle = "", x = "", y = "Rolling 3 year Returns (Ann.)") +
fmx_cols() 



```

This figure illustrates a distinct relationship between the Dollar (acting as the Carry Index) and the Rand; when the Dollar appreciates, it tends to coincide with a subsequent depreciation in the Rand's value. This relationship can be interpreted as a result of supply and demand dynamics within these currencies. For instance, increased demand for the Rand could drive its depreciation. This pattern suggests that when the Dollar displays strength, the Rand appears relatively cheaper, indicating an environment where there's heightened investment in the Rand, typically reflecting a risk-on sentiment

# Results

In periods of lowest flows, the top three funds—E473, N924, R928—show an upward trend in returns, whereas the bottom three funds—D394, T410, U411—indicate a downward trend. Conversely, during periods of highest flows, the top three funds exhibit both upward and downward trends in returns, while the bottom three funds showcase an upward trend. Consequently, it appears that the fund performance does not consistently align with the flow pattern, indicating that flow volume might not serve as a reliable predictor of fund returns.
